# Votify app ðŸš€

## Screens

- Users

## Run application locally


- clone the repository
- you will need file .env with credentials in the main folder, which I will send you

- install all dependencies with command `npm install` (make sure you have Node.js installed)

## To open tests dashboard, in main folder, run:

`npx cypress open`

It is possible that cypress will have problems to open Chrome (check cypress's logs). If thats the case, use Electron as the default browser.

## To run the tests in headless mode, in main folder, run:

`npx cypress run`


### Additional Notes

- If you don't have npm installed, you can get it by installing Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js installation.
