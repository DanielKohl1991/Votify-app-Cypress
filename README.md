# Votify app ðŸš€

## Screens

- Users

## Run application locally

- you will need file .env in the main folder with credentials, which I will send you

- install all dependencies with command `npm install`

## To open tests dashboard, in main folder, run:

`npx cypress open`

It is possible that cypress will have problems to open Chrome (check cypress's logs). If thats the case, use Electron as the default browser.

## To run the tests in headless mode, in main folder, run:

`npx cypress run`
